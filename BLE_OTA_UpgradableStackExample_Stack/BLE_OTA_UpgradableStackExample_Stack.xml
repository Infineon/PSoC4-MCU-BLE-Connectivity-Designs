  <Description>This example shows how to build a Stack only project for a BLE design. This project is required for designs that need Over the Air upgrade capability for both Application and the BLE stack. The Design has a BLE component configured as a “Stack Only”. The BLE component initialized with a Bootloader service is used as the transport for the bootloader packets from the host. The project also has a bootloader component that uses the packets received from the host to conduct the bootload process.</Description>
